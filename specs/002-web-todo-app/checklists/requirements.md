# Specification Quality Checklist: Interactive Web Todo Application

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-01
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain

- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
- [x] All 10 user stories have complete acceptance scenarios
- [x] All 35 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-035) are defined
- [x] All 20 success criteria (SC-001 through SC-020) are measurable
- [x] Edge cases are documented (EC-001 through EC-010)
- [x] Assumptions and dependencies are clearly stated

## Validation Summary

The specification has been thoroughly reviewed and meets all quality criteria:

- 20 success criteria (SC-001 through SC-020) with measurable outcomes
- All edge cases documented including advanced features
- Clear in-scope and out-of-scope boundaries
- Enhanced Task entity with all required attributes (priority, category, due_date, recurrence, completed_at)
- Updated Task management responsibilities to include advanced functionality
- No implementation details or technology-specific requirements in user-facing sections
- All success criteria are user-focused and measurable
